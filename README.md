# Help Search React test 

## Context

This app will allow the user to enter in the search bar and clicks the search button this will query the search api and return the first 10 results. 

## Future Work

If more time was given, functionality such as multiple search pages and the ability to browser back to previous query would be added. As well as improved search functionality such as error states, autocomplete and improved styling. Styling would be improved as well. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
